1)How many backend generators are available for CMake on multilab machines?
	5

2)What are the setting CMake uses with GCC to do a release build?
	-O3 -DNDEBUG

3)Update timestamp of top-level CMakeLists.txt, rerun make.  What happens?
	make rechecks configuration, regenerates, then rewrites build files.

4)What is the approximate speedup when building serial vs parallel with "-j 4"?
	serial: 2.567s, parallel: 2.117s
	speedup: ~1.213

5)The speed up in build time for CMake monolithic version is considerably
  larger than library version.  Why?
	I have no idea what "monolithic" means, and searching the cmake
	documentation only turned up something called "CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL"
	which did not affect the build time when set to 1.
	If I had to guess, I'm going to say that any speedup in build time 
	for the monolithic version is due to the compiler/linker(?) knowing
	how the files link up at the time it is built, giving the tools the 
	ability to separate out processes more precisely.
