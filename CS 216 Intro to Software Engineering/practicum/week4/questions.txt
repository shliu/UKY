1)Does optimization increase or decrease the size of the class object file?
	Decreases class object file size.

2)Does optimization increase or decrease the size of the main object file?
	Increases main object file size.

3)Does optimization increase or decrease the execution time?
	Decreases the execution time.

4)Why are the execution times not identical for subsequent program runs?
	Likely because there are other programs running on the same server.
	While running my program, I used the command "top" to watch the list
	of running processes.  I noticed that there are many other processes
	running at the same time as my program.  Occasionally, other students
	were running their own GeometricSeries program, using up the cpu.

5)Based on 5 consecutive measurements, find speedup ratio of non/opt.
	using ratio = .5 and n = 10,000,000
	opt1: 13.6948		non1: 13.8736
	opt2: 13.7018		non2: 13.8999
	opt3: 13.8158		non3: 13.9151
	opt4: 13.724		non4: 13.9148
	opt5: 13.6812		non5: 13.9246
	avgopt: 13.7235		avgnon: 13.9056
	
	speedup ratio: 13.9056/13.7235 = 1.0133 
	~1.33% speed up
