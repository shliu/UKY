We were unable to make the program do exact as the milestone A demanded.  
However, we were able to make our program perform while, do/while, 
and repeat/until loops correctly.  

Although we were able to analyze and learn the general concept of the 
functions of symbol_table.cc, we were unsuccessful in attempting to integrate
it into our program.

The code has been left at its latest state - it's not able to correctly
compile but we feel we were close to achieving milestone A.
